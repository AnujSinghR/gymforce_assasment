the gym force give me a task to fix 6 Issues in to Do app and integrate react with material ui .

lets discuss how i fix each Issues

# 1 Displaying Tasks

in this issue the application is unable to display tasks so this issue occurs because the todoitem.label and todoitem.id and checked not created in todos object so i created that and fixed it...

# 2 Layout Adjustment
in this issue i just applied the display to todos parent component and flex-direction column

# 3 Adding a New Task 
in this issue the add new task functionality in not working because add to do function in not created at this point so i created it and fixed it.

# 4 Task Toggling
in this issue the Toggling functionality is not working because i already mantioned the some states are not created in todos object

# 5 Task Deletion 
this is an issue which stucks me at the point because when a state is created then updeting a states array is a littile bit harder but i have fixed it by cloning the todos object and then updating it..

# 6 Counting Completed Tasks

# you have not mantioned but i fixed one more issue
